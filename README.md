Rescuetime sucks! They make you pay for your own data that they harvested from you. Plus they could be doing a lot more interesting stuff with all that data. This sounds like a job for... HACKERS!

`./osascript getapp` gets the title of the currently running app (should be "johnfn/revivetime" for you)

Compiling test.c, then running `./a.out` will get you the name of the currently running app (should be "Google Chrome" or "Mozilla Firefox" or whatever).
