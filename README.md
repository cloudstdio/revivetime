Rescuetime sucks! They make you pay for your own data that they harvested from you. Plus they could be doing a lot more interesting stuff with all that data. This sounds like a job for... HACKERS!

`dump.rb` currently dumps the time, the open app (e.g. "Google Chrome"), and a little more info if possible (e.g. "Github").
